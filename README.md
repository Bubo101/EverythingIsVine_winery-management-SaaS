## Intended Market
The people that we expect to use this application are
those that are looking for a simple way to browse through an 
online winery and place an order for the wines they want. We are also
marketing to Winery's that are looking to have a simple to use website that allows them to easily add and update inventory, and quickly generate revenue from sales.

* Wine Connoisseurs
* New Winery Owners

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP is an application that allows a winery to list their wines and update their wine inventory. Guests will be able to add wines to their shopping cart and checkout. Once payment (for now, a function) is made, it will generate the order with relation to the shopping items.


## Functionality
* Guests can sign up for an account with the winery to become members.
* Guests or members can look through the current winery inventory.
* Guests or members can add available wines to their shopping carts.
* Guests or members can edit wines in their shopping carts.
* Guests or members can make an order once a payment is made.
* Management can add and update inventory.

## Stretch Goals
