Today, I worked on:

* Updating the files: api.md, data-model.md, & integrations.md

Yesterday our group dove deep into the design portion of the application. We took the time to explore all options for implementation, and choose the best routes based on what our goals were for our MVP, and where we wanted to take our project in the future. We were able to get rid of the fluff in some of our models, and come up with the most efficient version of our project.

Today I learned about domain names and how we could hide information from the user that would be helpful for us with redirects in the backend.
