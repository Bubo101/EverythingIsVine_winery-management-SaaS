Today we wen't over the models as a group and then I made the mistake of merging to the main branch without making sure my docker containers were up and running. So we sorted that out, troubleshooted with daniel and fixed the main branch. We also had some ghi issues and we had to delete package-lock and node modules, then rebuild.
