Our main issue for today was resolving our Docker containers. After one of our teammates pushed his creation of models to our main branch, our containers would start and stop very quickly. We had Daniel come in to assist us with our file names as well as error messages. We ended up fixing everything and all of our teammates were able to begin their work. What ultimately fixed the container issue was renaming files, commenting out several import statements, and creating a grahphical human interface volume before building our containers. We also had a group discussion about the shopping cart component for our project and whather it would exist in our database before or after the user places an order.
