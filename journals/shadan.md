Our main issue for today was resolving our Docker containers. After one of our teammates pushed his creation of models to our main branch, our containers would start and stop very quickly. We had Daniel come in to assist us with our file names as well as error messages. We ended up fixing everything and all of our teammates were able to begin their work. What ultimately fixed the container issue was renaming files, commenting out several import statements, and creating a grahphical human interface volume before building our containers. We also had a group discussion about the shopping cart component for our project and whether it would exist in our database before or after the user places an order.

Today, I did a great amount of work on our navigation menu for the front-end portion of our project. I began by creating a components folder and creating a navigation index file as well as a file for navigation elements. I created styled components for all the elements of our navigation bar and implemented it. I then created a responsive menu icon with a drop down for our navigation links. It will appear when the screen reaches the width specified in the styled menu components. I then added on click handlers for the links and will continue to do so tomorrow.

Today, the group and I faced an issue with our merge conflicts when we pull from our main branch. Collaborating with Andrew, we identified the problem coming from our node modules and package lock files. Kayli updated our main branch from the web and we were all able to pull normally without facing unresolved merges. Kayli and I discussed how to manipulate state for our details page and decided to do independent research on the matter, then reconvene to begin working on it. Boden and I collaborated and made our front end portion uniform and begin to route our pages correctly.

Today, our entire group worked on resolving many merge conflicts and some changes that were different between the branches. Some of our members hadn't pushed to our main branch in a while so we had to push and pull and resolve everything together. We are most likely going to freeze every branch and work on one main branch for deployment.
