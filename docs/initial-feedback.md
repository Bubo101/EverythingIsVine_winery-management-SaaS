## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
I like the idea of building out a SaaS offering and there is no shortage of wine drinkers and the boutique wine market seems to keep on growing. On the business side, how might you go about attracting customers?

### Scope of work

### Integrations
In addition to a payment processor you probably also want to have an integration with a mail/delivery service (FEDEx, UPS, USPS, ...) to handle the pick-up and shipping of your orders.

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
